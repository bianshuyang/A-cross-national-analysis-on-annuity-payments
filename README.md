# A Cross-national Analysis on Annuity Payments

## Abstract

### Background
The insurance industry exhibits dynamic interactions and imperfect information, which often hinder companies from acquiring comprehensive data on their policyholders. This complexity requires an understanding of numerous risk factors, and insurers can leverage population insights to formulate policies and support national health strategies.

### Objective
This study introduces a mathematical model for creating fair annuity values in life insurance, ensuring sufficient cash flow for beneficiaries upon a policyholder's death. The model employs the Gompertz-Makeham (GM) mortality formula to determine age-related death probabilities and uses commutation functions for streamlined computations. Additionally, a unique cash flow function considers each policyholder's expenses, income, and assets, maximizing their utility.

### Data and Methods
Using data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), we calibrated and tested our model across 41 countries between 1959 and 2020. The results validate the model's applicability for calculating annuity payments, accounting for individual circumstances, life expectancy variability, and fluctuating annual income.

### Results
Results are discussed in detail in the project, including correlations, validations, and the creation of an interest-based 3D model of the annuity.

### Policy Implication
In addition to the model's immediate utility, this study examines the societal aspects of issuing insurance policies, network effects, and potential insights extending beyond traditional risk management.
